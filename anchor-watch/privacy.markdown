      <h1>Anchor Watch Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated 22.02.2024</p>

      <h2>Plain English</h2>
      <p>
        Anchor Watch never transmits your identifiable information anywhere.
        Some basic analytics are captured in a privacy-first way. These
        analytics are used to improve the app, and cannot be traced back to
        you. The app needs access to your location to do its job, but the
        location data is never shared with anyone.
      </p>

      <h2>Legal Speak</h2>
      <p>
        Anchor Watch never transmits your identifiable information anywhere.
        Some basic analytics are captured in a privacy-first way. These
        analytics are used to improve the app, and cannot be traced back to
        you.

      <h3>Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

      <p>
        Anchor Watch does not gather or transmit any Personally-Identifying
        Information outside of your local device. It only stores preferences
        about the user interface within its own database. Your anchor
        history and some other information about your use are stored in
        iCloud, but are never transmitted to me.
      </p>

      <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
      <p>
        If Anchor Watch, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired,
        or in the unlikely event that Anchor Watch goes out of business or
        enters bankruptcy, this policy and its effects may change or be
        amended. (Since Anchor Watch does not collect any information about
        you it's quite unlikely this privacy policy will be changed.)
      </p>
      <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
      <p>
        Although most changes are likely to be minor, Anchor Watch may
        change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Anchor Watch's
        sole discretion. Your continued use of this app after any change in
        this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
      </p>
      <h3>Indemnity</h3>
      <p>
        You hereby indemnify us and undertake to keep us indemnified against
        any losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including,
        without limitation, legal expenses and any amounts paid by us to a
        third party in settlement of a claim or dispute on the advice of our
        legal advisers) incurred or suffered by us arising out of any breach
        by you of any provision of these terms of use, or arising out of any
        claim that you have breached any provision of these terms of use.
